## When to Use These

**After Phase 1 is successfully deployed and validated**, use these documents to:
- Rebuild with modern Next.js stack
- Add advanced features (Whisper, real-time video, etc.)
- Implement all LLM-optimized prompts
- Deploy production-grade architecture

## Current Priority

**Deploy Phase 1 First!**

Just need your:
- Railway backend URL

Then Phase 2 can begin in parallel.
